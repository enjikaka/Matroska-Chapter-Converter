Matroska-Chapter-Converter
==========================

This little tool converts chapters for Matroska (XML-format), which you can export with MKVToolNix, to SRT-subtitles that you can put in the MKV file.

The SRT file will display the chapter name in the subtitles for amount of seconds you specify.
